<h4>About my activity on Github:</h4>
<blockquote>
I program almost daily and mainly in Java and Kotlin.<br />
For this I mostly use tools like Maven and Gradle, as well as Docker.<br /> 
Since my company doesn't use GitHub, you won't see that much activity on my account.<br />
But I have some projects on my todo list, some of which I am already developing.
